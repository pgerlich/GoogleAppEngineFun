# Guestbook
I have created a basic guestbook (through the appspot "Getting Started" tutorial) as a means of familiarizing myself with Google App Engine.

#To-Do list
Additionally, I created a simple to-do list application. This services requires you to login with your google gmail account. After logging in, you can add, update, and delete/"complete" tasks. 

If you would like to take them on the go, you may also send your to-do list to yourself via email.
